# cfireborn.github.io

This repository hosts a collection of small web games and demos.
All pages are static and can be opened directly in a browser.

### Activity Log

The `activitylog` directory contains a small demo that records
clicked actions with random creative blurbs. Open `activitylog/index.html`
in a browser to try it out.

## Development

Simply edit the files in place and open `index.html` or any of the
subfolders' `index.html` in a browser to test locally.

## Previewing Pull Requests

This repository uses the [preview-pages](https://github.com/rajyan/preview-pages)
action to automatically deploy a preview of each pull request. A comment with
the preview link is added to the PR and the workflow logs print the same URL.
Previews are hosted under
`https://cfireborn.github.io/preview-pages/pr-<number>/` so you can review the
changes before merging.
