This repository hosts a collection of small web games and demos.
All pages are static and can be opened directly in a browser.

### Activity Log

The `activitylog` directory contains a small demo that records
clicked actions with random creative blurbs. Open `activitylog/index.html`
in a browser to try it out.

## Development

Simply edit the files in place and open `index.html` or any of the
subfolders' `index.html` in a browser to test locally.

## Previewing Pull Requests

A GitHub Actions workflow automatically deploys previews for every pull
request. Once you open a PR, the "Deploy static site to GitHub Pages"
check will provide a URL where you can view the proposed changes.
