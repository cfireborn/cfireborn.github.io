# Heartbreak Healing

A small interactive page to visualize healing progress and generate supportive emojis.
Click any action button to spawn an encouraging emoji, add a note to the activity log at the bottom of the page, and boost healing progress by 1%.
Use the shuffle button to see Charlie drawn in a different art style while staying in the same emotional stage.

Edit `script.js` for functionality and `styles.css` for layout/styling. Page is in `index.html`.
