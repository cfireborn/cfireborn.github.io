Grief is a ball bouncing around the room. Every time it hits a button on the floor it's extremely painful. And as time goes on, the button doesn't get smaller but the room gets bigger as you fill your life up with other things and expand your world beyond them. Bring other things into your life so you think of them less often- Anh, Day 1 July 12
